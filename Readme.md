Curiosity@Play
--------------

Android remote control application
----------------------------------

This is a mobile GUI for simplified planning of Curiosity robot operations.
 
Inspired by visual programming languages, the aim is to help learn basic computer programming skills, 
through a timed challenge.

Young user is able to plan the future actions to be performed by the robot :
  - Move forward
  - Rotate
  - Perform a sensor action (dig, ChemCam laser shoot, ...)
    
The realtime trajectory is shown thanks to a processing server sketches (in sketch directory).

To enhance user engagement, the program is eventually uploaded to a real robot
